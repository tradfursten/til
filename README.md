> Today I Learned

Inspired by [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til). I'll try to add something that I've learned every day for my own learning process.

## Usage

To auto-generate the README.md file, you can run
```
./createReadme.py > README.md
```

If you are using git, you can install this script as a pre-commit git hook so
that it is autogenerated on each commit.  Use the following command:
```
cd .git/hooks/ && ln -s ../../createReadme.py pre-commit && cd -
```

## About

I shamelessly stole this idea from
[thoughtbot/til](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til).
